## Overview

MoneyMoover is a **CLI application for managing and transferring international currencies**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the features of other money management applications.

Our app will help students to **track their expenses and income** in order to stay within their budgets, so that they have enough money to travel. It will also help them convert to foreign currencies so they can see how much they have to spend overseas.

## Enhancements Implemented

### UI Class

I am in charge of writing the `UI Class` which is used to mainly handle the User Interface aspect. This includes reading in input, printing message and printing formatted strings. It mainly hides the complex features so that the other developers can get the intended input.

### Balance Command

I am in charged of writing the `BalanceCommand` class for the project. This class is mainly used to show the balance in a specific account or all the accounts depending on the parameters provided.

### Add Command

I am in charge of writing the `AddCommand` class for the project. This class is mainly used to empower the users to add funds into the account based on the specified currency.

### Validation Class

I am in charge of writing a class that is used to validate the amount that is read in by the user. This class is used to validate and see whether the amount provided by the user contains any alphabetical characters or lie within the range of 0 to 10 million dollars.

### Contributions to the UG

I have updated the UG for the AddCommand and BalanceCommand with the expected outputs after I am done with the working on them.
